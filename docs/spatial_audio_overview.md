## Introduction

Our spatial audio system aims to create realistic 3D audio by simulating how sound waves propagate through a virtual environment. We use a physics-based approach that combines:

- Geometric acoustic raytracing to model sound propagation
- Frequency-dependent material properties for realistic reflections
- Binaural rendering for immersive 3D audio perception
- GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks

The end result is a system that can generate realistic impulse responses (IRs) for any position in a virtual room, which can then be used to spatialize audio sources through convolution.

## Raytracing for Spatial Audio

### Core Principles

Raytracing for spatial audio follows similar principles to visual raytracing but with important acoustic considerations:

1. **Sound Source Emission**: Rays are emitted from a sound source in all directions
2. **Ray Propagation**: Rays travel through the environment at the speed of sound (343 m/s)
3. **Surface Interactions**: Rays interact with surfaces based on acoustic properties:
   - Reflection (specular and diffuse)
   - Absorption (frequency-dependent)
   - Scattering (frequency-dependent)
4. **Energy Tracking**: Each ray carries energy across multiple frequency bands (125Hz-16kHz)
5. **Listener Detection**: Rays that reach the listener contribute to the impulse response

### Raytracing Implementation

Our raytracing implementation uses WebGPU compute shaders for parallel processing:

1. **Ray Generation**:
   - Rays are generated from the sound source position
   - Initial ray directions are distributed uniformly using spherical coordinates
   - Each ray carries energy across 8 frequency bands (125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz, 16kHz)

2. **Ray Propagation**:
   - The `raytracer.wgsl` compute shader processes rays in parallel
   - Rays are traced through the environment until they:
     - Reach maximum bounce count (typically 50)
     - Energy falls below a threshold (typically 0.05)
     - Exit the environment

3. **Surface Interaction**:
   - When a ray hits a surface, it calculates:
     - Reflection direction (based on surface normal)
     - Energy attenuation (based on material properties)
     - Frequency-dependent absorption
     - Scattering effects

4. **Ray Hit Collection**:
   - All ray hits are collected and stored with:
     - Position
     - Time (arrival time relative to direct sound)
     - Direction
     - Energy (across frequency bands)
     - Surface normal
     - Bounce count

## Impulse Response Generation

### From Ray Hits to Impulse Response

The process of converting ray hits to an impulse response involves:

1. **Temporal Mapping**:
   - Each ray hit is mapped to a specific time in the impulse response
   - Time is calculated based on the ray's travel distance and the speed of sound

2. **Spatial Processing**:
   - Ray hits are processed with spatial audio cues:
     - Interaural Time Difference (ITD)
     - Interaural Level Difference (ILD)
     - Direction-dependent filtering

3. **Energy Distribution**:
   - Energy from ray hits is distributed across the impulse response
   - Early reflections (< 100ms) are processed individually
   - Late reflections are processed statistically

### GPU-Accelerated IR Generation

The `spatial_audio.wgsl` compute shader performs key calculations for IR generation:

1. **Wave Contribution Calculation**:
   - Calculates the contribution of each ray hit to the impulse response
   - Applies phase, frequency, and amplitude modulation
   - Accounts for Doppler shift and distance attenuation

2. **HRTF Approximation**:
   - Calculates simplified HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) effects
   - Generates left and right channel gains based on ray direction
   - Applies directional attenuation based on listener orientation

3. **Frequency-Dependent Processing**:
   - Processes each frequency band with appropriate characteristics
   - Applies frequency-dependent air absorption
   - Implements frequency-dependent energy decay

## GPU-CPU Task Division

Our system divides tasks between GPU and CPU to optimize performance:

### GPU Tasks (WebGPU Compute Shaders)

1. **Ray Propagation and Physics** (`raytracer.wgsl`):
   - Ray-surface intersection calculations
   - Reflection vector computation
   - Energy propagation across frequency bands
   - Air absorption and attenuation calculations

2. **Initial IR Processing** (`spatial_audio.wgsl`):
   - Wave contribution calculations
   - Basic HRTF approximation
   - Frequency-dependent energy decay
   - Parallel processing of ray hits

### CPU Tasks (JavaScript/TypeScript)

1. **Audio Buffer Management** (`audio-processor_modified.ts`):
   - Creating and managing AudioContext and AudioBuffers
   - Setting up the Web Audio API convolution pipeline
   - Handling audio file loading and playback

2. **Advanced Spatial Processing**:
   - Gain and ITD (Interaural Time Difference) calculations
   - Temporal spreading for natural sound
   - Crossfading between early reflections and late reverberation

3. **Late Reverberation** (`diffuse-field-model_modified.ts`):
   - Statistical modeling of late reverberation
   - Feedback delay networks for dense reverberation
   - Stereo decorrelation for spatial impression

4. **Audio Rendering and Playback**:
   - Convolution of audio sources with the impulse response
   - Real-time audio playback
   - Visualization of impulse responses

## Audio Processing Pipeline

The complete audio processing pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Ray Tracing Simulation**:
   - `calculateIR()` in `main.ts` initiates the process
   - `rayTracer.calculateRayPaths()` simulates sound propagation
   - Ray hit data is collected with position, time, energy, and direction information

2. **Audio Processing**:
   - Ray hit data is passed to `audioProcessor.processRayHits()`
   - `processRayHitsInternal()` processes hits into a stereo impulse response
   - Early reflections (< 100ms) use the Gain + ITD model with temporal spreading
   - Late reverberation (â‰¥ 100ms) is generated using `DiffuseFieldModelModified`

3. **Impulse Response Assembly**:
   - Early reflections and late reverberation are combined with a crossfade (80-120ms)
   - The final impulse response is normalized and stored in an `AudioBuffer`
   - The impulse response is visualized using the waveform renderer

4. **Audio Spatialization**:
   - Audio sources are convolved with the impulse response
   - The result is played back through the Web Audio API
   - Real-time updates occur as the listener or source moves

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frequency-Dependent Material Properties

Materials in our system have frequency-dependent properties:

- **Absorption Coefficients**: How much energy is absorbed at each frequency band
- **Scattering Coefficients**: How much energy is scattered vs. specularly reflected
- **Transmission Coefficients**: How much energy passes through the material (future work)

### Air Absorption Modeling

Sound attenuation in air is modeled with:

- Temperature-dependent absorption
- Humidity-dependent absorption
- Frequency-dependent absorption (higher frequencies attenuate more quickly)

### Wave Phenomena

Our system models several wave phenomena:

- **Phase Effects**: Constructive and destructive interference
- **Doppler Shift**: Frequency changes due to relative motion
- **Diffraction**: Simplified modeling around edges (future enhancement)

### Performance Optimizations

To maintain real-time performance:

1. **Compute Shader Optimizations**:
   - Workgroup size of 256 for efficient GPU utilization
   - Minimized divergent execution paths
   - Optimized memory access patterns

2. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Image source method for early reflections (up to 2nd order)
   - Stochastic ray tracing for late reflections
   - Statistical modeling for very late reverberation

## Code Examples

This section provides code examples and pseudocode for key functions in our spatial audio system to illustrate the implementation details of critical calculations.

### 1. Wave Contribution Calculation (GPU)

The following WGSL code from `spatial_audio.wgsl` shows how we calculate the wave contribution for each ray hit:

```wgsl
fn calculateWaveContribution(
    time: f32,
    phase: f32,
    frequency: f32,
    dopplerShift: f32,
    amplitude: f32,
    distance: f32
) -> f32 {
    // Validate inputs to prevent NaN/Infinity
    let validFreq = max(frequency, 20.0);
    let validAmplitude = max(amplitude, 0.0);
    let validDistance = max(distance, 0.001);

    // Apply Doppler shift to frequency
    let shiftedFreq = validFreq * max(dopplerShift, 0.1);

    // Calculate wavelength and phase based on distance
    let wavelength = SPEED_OF_SOUND / shiftedFreq;
    let distancePhase = 2.0 * 3.14159 * validDistance / wavelength;
    let totalPhase = phase + distancePhase;

    // Apply window function for temporal shaping
    let windowPos = clamp(time / (validDistance / SPEED_OF_SOUND), 0.0, 1.0);
    let window = 0.8 * (1.0 - cos(2.0 * 3.14159 * windowPos));

    // Apply distance-based attenuation
    let earlyBoost = 3.0;
    let distanceAttenuation = 1.0 / max(validDistance * validDistance, 0.01);

    // Apply frequency-dependent boost based on room acoustics
    var freqBoost = 1.0;
    if (validFreq < 250.0) {
        freqBoost = mix(1.2, 1.0, (validFreq - 20.0) / 230.0);  // Bass boost
    } else if (validFreq < 4000.0) {
        freqBoost = mix(1.0, 1.1, (validFreq - 250.0) / 3750.0);  // Mid boost
    } else {
        freqBoost = mix(1.1, 0.9, (validFreq - 4000.0) / 12000.0);  // High attenuation
    }

    // Combine all factors and apply sinusoidal oscillation
    return validAmplitude * earlyBoost * window * sin(totalPhase) * distanceAttenuation * freqBoost;
}
```

This function models how sound waves propagate through space, accounting for:
- Phase changes based on distance
- Doppler shift effects
- Distance-based attenuation (inverse square law)
- Frequency-dependent boost/attenuation
- Temporal windowing for natural sound

### 2. Interaural Time Difference Calculation (CPU)

The following TypeScript code from `audio-processor_modified.ts` shows how we calculate the Interaural Time Difference (ITD):

```typescript
// Calculate ITD in samples based on azimuth angle
private calculateITDsamples(azimuthRad: number, sampleRate: number): number {
    // Constants
    const HEAD_RADIUS = 0.0875; // Average human head radius in meters
    const SPEED_OF_SOUND = 343.0; // Speed of sound in m/s

    // Woodworth's formula (simplified)
    // ITD = (r/c) * (Î¸ + sin(Î¸)) where r is head radius, c is speed of sound, Î¸ is azimuth

    // Ensure azimuth is within -Ï€ to Ï€ range
    const normalizedAzimuth = Math.atan2(Math.sin(azimuthRad), Math.cos(azimuthRad));

    // Calculate ITD in seconds
    // Use absolute value for calculation, then restore sign
    const absAzimuth = Math.abs(normalizedAzimuth);
    const itdSeconds = (HEAD_RADIUS / SPEED_OF_SOUND) * (absAzimuth + Math.sin(absAzimuth));

    // Convert to samples and apply sign based on original azimuth
    const itdSamples = itdSeconds * sampleRate * Math.sign(normalizedAzimuth);

    // Clamp to reasonable range (typically max ~1ms or ~44 samples at 44.1kHz)
    const MAX_ITD_SAMPLES = 44;
    return Math.max(-MAX_ITD_SAMPLES, Math.min(MAX_ITD_SAMPLES, itdSamples));
}
```

This function implements Woodworth's formula for ITD calculation, which models the time difference between when sound reaches each ear based on the azimuth angle. The ITD is a critical cue for horizontal sound localization.

### 3. Frequency-Dependent Energy Decay (GPU)

The following WGSL code shows how we calculate frequency-dependent energy decay:

```wgsl
fn calculateEnergyDecay(time: f32, distance: f32, direction: vec3f, normal: vec3f) -> FrequencyBands {
    // Base decay factor (time-dependent)
    let timeDecay = exp(-3.0 * time);

    // Distance-dependent decay
    let distanceDecay = 1.0 / max(distance * distance, 0.01);

    // Direction-dependent decay (grazing angle effect)
    let directionFactor = max(dot(direction, normal), 0.01);

    // Frequency-dependent decay factors
    // Lower frequencies decay more slowly than higher frequencies
    let band125decay = timeDecay * 0.95;
    let band250decay = timeDecay * 0.92;
    let band500decay = timeDecay * 0.90;
    let band1kdecay = timeDecay * 0.87;
    let band2kdecay = timeDecay * 0.84;
    let band4kdecay = timeDecay * 0.80;
    let band8kdecay = timeDecay * 0.75;
    let band16kdecay = timeDecay * 0.70;

    // Apply distance and direction factors
    let commonFactor = distanceDecay * directionFactor;

    return FrequencyBands(
        band125decay * commonFactor,
        band250decay * commonFactor,
        band500decay * commonFactor,
        band1kdecay * commonFactor,
        band2kdecay * commonFactor,
        band4kdecay * commonFactor,
        band8kdecay * commonFactor,
        band16kdecay * commonFactor
    );
}
```

This function models how sound energy decays over time, with different rates for different frequency bands. Higher frequencies decay faster than lower frequencies, which is consistent with real-world acoustics.

### 4. Ray-Surface Interaction with Material Properties (GPU)

The following pseudocode illustrates how ray-surface interactions are computed with material properties:

```wgsl
fn calculateRayReflection(
    ray: Ray,
    hitPoint: vec3f,
    normal: vec3f,
    material: Material
) -> ReflectionResult {
    // Calculate reflection direction (specular component)
    let incidentDir = normalize(ray.direction);
    let specularDir = reflect(incidentDir, normal);

    // Calculate diffuse (scattered) direction
    let randomVec = generateRandomVector(ray.seed);
    let diffuseDir = normalize(normal + randomVec);

    // Initialize energy bands for the reflected ray
    var reflectedEnergy: FrequencyBands;

    // Apply frequency-dependent absorption for each band
    reflectedEnergy.band125 = ray.energy.band125 * (1.0 - material.absorption_125);
    reflectedEnergy.band250 = ray.energy.band250 * (1.0 - material.absorption_250);
    reflectedEnergy.band500 = ray.energy.band500 * (1.0 - material.absorption_500);
    reflectedEnergy.band1k = ray.energy.band1k * (1.0 - material.absorption_1k);
    reflectedEnergy.band2k = ray.energy.band2k * (1.0 - material.absorption_2k);
    reflectedEnergy.band4k = ray.energy.band4k * (1.0 - material.absorption_4k);
    reflectedEnergy.band8k = ray.energy.band8k * (1.0 - material.absorption_8k);
    reflectedEnergy.band16k = ray.energy.band16k * (1.0 - material.absorption_16k);

    // Apply scattering - mix between specular and diffuse reflection
    let finalDirection: vec3f;
    for (var i = 0u; i < 8u; i++) {
        // Get scattering coefficient for this frequency band
        let scatteringCoeff = getScatteringCoeff(material, i);

        // Mix between specular and diffuse based on scattering coefficient
        if (random(ray.seed + i) < scatteringCoeff) {
            // Use diffuse direction for this frequency component
            // (In practice, we use one direction for all bands but with energy adjustment)
        }
    }

    // Determine final direction (simplified - in practice we'd use energy splitting)
    let avgScattering = calculateAverageScattering(material);
    finalDirection = mix(specularDir, diffuseDir, avgScattering);

    // Create reflection result
    return ReflectionResult(
        hitPoint,           // New ray origin
        finalDirection,     // New ray direction
        reflectedEnergy,    // Attenuated energy
        ray.bounces + 1u    // Increment bounce count
    );
}
```

This pseudocode demonstrates how we handle ray-surface interactions, including:
- Specular reflection calculation
- Diffuse (scattered) reflection
- Frequency-dependent absorption
- Material-dependent scattering
- Energy attenuation across frequency bands

These calculations are critical for realistic acoustic simulation as they determine how sound energy propagates through the environment after hitting surfaces with different acoustic properties.
